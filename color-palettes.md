## Design Thinking Notes

### Color Ratio Recommendations
For optimal visual hierarchy based on the logo:
- **60%**: Green (dominant, establishes brand presence)
- **30%**: White/Neutral (ensures readability and breathing room)
- **10%**: Red & Gold combined (strategic accents for emphasis)

### Accessibility Considerations
All palettes maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios:
- Green backgrounds with white text: âœ“ Excellent contrast
- Red used sparingly for accents, not primary text
- Gold used for borders and highlights, not body text

### Psychological Impact
- **Green**: Trust, growth, stability, health - positions SAJP as reliable and forward-thinking
- **Red**: Energy, urgency, passion - drives action and captures attention
- **Gold**: Quality, value, success - elevates brand perception
- **White**: Clarity, simplicity, professionalism - ensures clean communication
